# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the `MallCustomer.csv` dataset. By utilizing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and segmentation models, we will divide customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies and improved customer service.

## Dataset
The `MallCustomer.csv` dataset contains customer attributes such as Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

## File Structure
- `eda/`: Contains Python scripts for Exploratory Data Analysis of the MallCustomer dataset.
- `segment_model/`: Contains Python scripts for developing and validating customer segmentation models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process includes:
1. Data Analysis  
2. Data Visualization  
3. Statistical Analysis

## Segmentation Model
The segmentation model will be developed using clustering techniques. The process includes:
1. Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features for segmentation  
2. Model Selection: Evaluating different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.

## Dockerfile  
The `segmentasyon_model.py` file located under the `.src/` directory is layered through the Dockerfile in the project.

## GitHub Actions  
In the `.github/workflows` directory of the project, automation scenarios for GitHub Actions are available.

## Setup
Instructions for setting up the project environment.

## Usage
Instructions for running the EDA scripts and training/testing the segmentation model.
